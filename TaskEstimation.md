### **Introduction**

<br>

Task estimation is the process of finding an approximation. In other words a value based on some prior reference. For example if someone takes 10 minutes to complete one task we can then assume it will take them 50 minutes to complete five similar tasks. Based on the past history, future approximation can be planned.


#### **Benefits of Task Estimation**
- Identify the project completion date.
- Plan internal milestone.
- Plan the resources needed
- Decide the work scope

#### Challenges faced in Traditional Estimation

- Needs all the requirements before estimating.
- Too much time spent on estimation.
- There is a re-estimation of the entire project if one requirement is changed.
- In traditional estimation only a manager or expert will make the estimation.

#### Types of Agile Estimation

**Story point estimation**
    
    Relative estimation means that you judge how big or complex a task is with respect to other tasks within your sprint. One of the unit of complexities that can be used in this is story point estimation.
    
    A story point is the number that tells the team about the effort required to implement a user story. The effort required can be influenced by the amount of work to do, the risk and uncertainty and the complexity.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - The amount of work to do could be to fold 10 pieces of paper vs folding 100 pieces of paper. This is an easy task which would have a low story point however if you are required to do it 100 times the story point will increase even though the complexity is the same.
    - If a team is asked to estimate a user story and the requirements are unclear it should be reflected in the story point similarly if the the story requires sensitive changes such as old code that has no automated testing then that should also be reflected in the story points because of the risk and uncertainty.
    - If the task was to fold 100 pieces of paper into airplanes this would be the same as folding paper however the complexity has now greatly increased and should be reflected in the story points
    
    Story points use the **Fibonacci Sequence** as a scale for sizing. 
    
    What is the Fibonacci Sequence?
    
    A series of numbers in which each number ( *Fibonacci number*
     ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc
    
    Some teams use T-Shirt Sizing as a measure
    
    What is t-shirt sizing?
    
    T-shirt sizing is a relative estimation technique that uses t-shirt sizes rather than a number of planning poker.

    Story point estimation usually takes place during the product backlog refinement sessions. The product owner doesn’t estimate during the session but they are responsible for explaining the user stories to the team.
    
    Before estimation starts the team finds a reference user story that everyone in the team understands and can resonate with. Once the story is defined they then estimate the other user stories by comparing it to the reference story.
