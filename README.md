### **Introduction**

<br>


The term coding standards refers to a set of guidelines/recommendations programmers should follow to improve code readability and make for easier maintenance.
Each programming language has their own set of coding standards but they all tend to include rules for the same things such as naming conventions, indentation, leaving comments etc..


<br>


#### **Benefits of Coding Standards**

- Makes the code uniform, it looks and reads as though it has all been written by one person.
- Enables code to be reused.
- Makes it easier to spot and debug errors in code.
- Improves readability and makes code easier to maintain.
- Makes life easier for programmers as they donâ€™t have to design their own best way of naming, indenting, adding comments to code etc. they can just follow convention.
