## **Introduction**

<br>


Coding reviews are undertaken by companies and organisations for various reasons.

In today's dynamic and evolving coding environment code reviews are necessary to ensure members of organisation are following the same protocols and methods whilst coding.

Code reviews are generally conducted by peers and are often referred to as peer reviews. The reviewers often will not have personally been involved in the code they are reviewing. This allows less bias opinions and more pragmatic approach.

Reviews are intended to point out the positive and negative aspects of a project.
