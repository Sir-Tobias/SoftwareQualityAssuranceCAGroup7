### **Introduction**

<br>


The term coding standards refers to a set of guidelines/recommendations programmers should follow to improve code readability and make for easier maintenance.
Each programming language has their own set of coding standards but they all tend to include rules for the same things such as naming conventions, indentation, leaving comments etc..


<br>


### **Benefits of Coding Standards**

- Makes the code uniform, it looks and reads as though it has all been written by one person.
- Enables code to be reused.
- Makes it easier to spot and debug errors in code.
- Improves readability and makes code easier to maintain.
- Makes life easier for programmers as they don’t have to design their own best way of naming, indenting, adding comments to code etc. they can just follow convention.

<br>

## **Why are code standards important?**
**Two main reasons for the use of code standards are:**
<br>

</p>

**Performance**
<br>
Poor quality code is harder work with and leads to performance issues for both the end user and people working with the code directly. Coding standards serve to solve this by offering guidelines that improve code quality and reduce errors and make the code more efficient to run and to work with. 
<br>

</p>

**Security**
<br>
When code is buggy, has logical errors or is even just inconsistent in the way its written it becomes vulnerable to attack. Coding standards work to remove faulty code thus making it more secure.


<br>

## **Common things seen in coding standards:**

</p>

### **Use of Globals** 
How often and where programmers should use global variables.

  <img width="100" height="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/96/000000/--camel.png">
</p>

### **Naming Conventions:**
Programmers should indicate if a variable is local, global, a constant or a function by the way its name is declared. This is most often done through the use of camel case and capitalisation. Names should also be descriptive and kept as short as possible.

</p>

### **Indentation:**
This is one of the most important factors for code readability, tightly packed code becomes unreadable very quickly. This can be avoided by following indentation standards such as indenting and spacing each nested block of code.

  <img width="100" height="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/96/000000/length.png">
</p>

### **Function Length:**
Longer functions become very difficult to follow so it’s encouraged they are broken into smaller parts for each task the function is carrying out. 
<p align = "left">
  <img width="100" height="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/material-outlined/96/000000/comments--v1.png">
</p>

### **Documentation**
Programmers should document their code using comments so as if another person has to work with the code  they can quickly understand what is going on.

<br>

## **Conclusion**
Coding standards help in generating code that is easy to read, understand and maintain. This improves code security and makes working with the code more efficient which benefits both the end user and programmers. It’s for these reasons why it’s important to adhere to existing coding standards wherever possible and to be thorough when designing standards of your own.

### **Introduction**

<br>

Task estimation is the process of finding an approximation. In other words a value based on some prior reference. For example if someone takes 10 minutes to complete one task we can then assume it will take them 50 minutes to complete five similar tasks. Based on the past history, future approximation can be planned.


#### **Benefits of Task Estimation**
- Identify the project completion date.
- Plan internal milestone.
- Plan the resources needed
- Decide the work scope

#### Challenges faced in Traditional Estimation

- Needs all the requirements before estimating.
- Too much time spent on estimation.
- There is a re-estimation of the entire project if one requirement is changed.
- In traditional estimation only a manager or expert will make the estimation.

#### Types of Agile Estimation

**Story Point Estimation**

Relative estimation means that you judge how big or complex a task is with respect to other tasks within your sprint. One of the unit of complexities that can be used in this is story point estimation.

A story point is the number that tells the team about the effort required to implement a user story. The effort required can be influenced by the amount of work to do, the risk and uncertainty and the complexity.


**Factors to consider when estimation story points**
<br>

**Examples**

- The amount of work to do could be to fold 10 pieces of paper vs folding 100 pieces of paper. This is an easy task which would have a low story point however if you are required to do it 100 times the story point will increase even though the complexity is the same.
- If a team is asked to estimate a user story and the requirements are unclear it should be reflected in the story point similarly if the the story requires sensitive changes such as old code that has no automated testing then that should also be reflected in the story points because of the risk and uncertainty.
- If the task was to fold 100 pieces of paper into airplanes this would be the same as folding paper however the complexity has now greatly increased and should be reflected in the story points

Story points use the **Fibonacci Sequence** as a scale for sizing. 

What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

A series of numbers in which each number ( *Fibonacci number*
 ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc

Some teams use T-Shirt Sizing as a measure

What is t-shirt sizing?

T-shirt sizing is a relative estimation technique that uses t-shirt sizes rather than a number of planning poker.

![tshirt sizingi.PNG](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/de03c7b0-7bbf-4cbe-87b1-c01d99c1733e/tshirt_sizingi.png)

Story point estimation usually takes place during the product backlog refinement sessions. The product owner doesn’t estimate during the session but they are responsible for explaining the user stories to the team.

Before estimation starts the team finds a reference user story that everyone in the team understands and can resonate with. Once the story is defined they then estimate the other user stories by comparing it to the reference story.

**Top-down estimate**

Top-down estimating is a method of evaluating a project or budget as a whole and then separating it into smaller components. With a top-down approach, professionals create an overall plan or budget for a project without defining the particulars. These professionals would then give the project budget or plan to others who can better evaluate the specific costs or plan details.

**Example:**

When a new building is being built, many businesses will often use the top-down approach. The company manager will usually decide the location. However the manager will not know the specific costs or procedures for the construction for the new building. With the top-down approach the company can create a tentative plan and budget the purchase of the new building. The company can then alter the top-down estimates as the project details become more certain.

**Bottom-up estimate**

With a bottom-up approach, companies first determine the details of a plan or budget. Then they categorize and arrange those details into a more structured outline or budget. By contrast, the top-down method starts by focusing on a broad overview of the project and then becoming more specific in its plan details and costs.

**Differences between top-down and bottom-up estimations**

A top-down approach is often more efficient than a bottom-up approach for many reasons. When you use a top-down approach, the managers or other major company stakeholders create a project plan or budget on their own. Since they haven't yet determined the project details and exact costs, a top-down estimate would usually be more time efficient to make than a bottom-up estimate.

On the other hand a bottom-up approach can more efficiently handle challenges as the project gets underway than a top-down approach. Since a bottom-up approach begins with the details of a project, a bottom-up plan may minimize the risks or unexpected issues that arise as the project develops.

## **Introduction**

<br>


Coding reviews are undertaken by companies and organisations for various reasons.

In today's dynamic and evolving coding environment code reviews are necessary to ensure members of organisation are following the same protocols and methods whilst coding.

Code reviews are generally conducted by peers and are often referred to as peer reviews. The reviewers often will not have personally been involved in the code they are reviewing. This allows less bias opinions and more pragmatic approach.

Reviews are intended to point out the positive and negative aspects of a project.

<br>


### **Benefits of Code Reviews**

-	Adhering to Coding Standards
-	Team fluency & cohesion
-	Finding bugs & Errors
-	Teaching & Team development
-	Naming conventions & Comments



<br>

#### **Adhering to Coding Standards**
Companies will often have a guideline of coding Standards that are to be maintained by all members of the organisation

During code reviews the code itself is reviewed and ensured it follows the key principles set out in the organisations coding stands.

<br>

#### **Team Fluency & Cohesion**

<br>

<br>

When a code review is being undertaken it is important for the reviewer to keep the coder informed on their progress through the review.

Kepping both parties in the loop helps the reviwer have an understnading of the coders thought process and logic in certain areas.

If thing are unclear the reviwer will leave in their reviwe for an improvement in commenting and processes.



<br>

#### **Finding bugs & Errors**

<br>

<p align = "left">

</p>

<br>

Finding bugs and errors and bugs during a code review is one of the least costly ways of reviewing your code.

Having a new Un-biased set of eyes review changes and new methods allows for bugs to be spotted before they are released into production.


<br>

#### **Teaching & Team development**

<br>

</p>

<br>

Code reviews are valuable a part of a developers learning and progression. 

Having you peers and superiors review your code can allow for more learning and allows you to question your own process but also defend and explain your decisions.


<br>

#### **Naming conventions & Comments**



<br>

<p align = "left">
  <img width="150" height="150" src="https://icon-library.com/images/free-comment-icon/free-comment-icon-3.jpg">
</p>

<br>

Developers often get used to using industry standard when naming methods, classes and variables. but Companies often Follow their own naming conventions and styles.

This can often be a steep learning curve new employees no matter their level of experience.
People develop habits over time and get used to doing things a certain way. 

This is code reviews are extremely beneficial when a new employee is learning an organizations commenting rules and best practices.


Clear precise comments allow for future an ease in future adaptation and understanding. Which in turn allows for future adaptation and understanding from the next team member to work on the code


<br>

## **Conclusion**

Code reviews can be extremely beneficial and often even enjoyable when done correctly. 

Effective code reviews can lead to higher quality code, better cohesion and understanding of commenting 
, good knowledge sharing between teams in and organization and an overall improvement in team culture.

Code should also be reviewed in agile form. Review no more than 400 lines of code per session.

This should thin be brought to the coder to review the code between themselves and reviewer.
