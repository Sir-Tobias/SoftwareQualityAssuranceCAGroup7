### **Introduction**

<br>


The term coding standards refers to a set of guidelines/recommendations programmers should follow to improve code readability and make for easier maintenance.
Each programming language has their own set of coding standards but they all tend to include rules for the same things such as naming conventions, indentation, leaving comments etc..


<br>


### **Benefits of Coding Standards**

- Makes the code uniform, it looks and reads as though it has all been written by one person.
- Enables code to be reused.
- Makes it easier to spot and debug errors in code.
- Improves readability and makes code easier to maintain.
- Makes life easier for programmers as they don’t have to design their own best way of naming, indenting, adding comments to code etc. they can just follow convention.

<br>

## **Why are code standards important?**
**Two main reasons for the use of code standards are:**
<br>

</p>

**Performance**
<br>
Poor quality code is harder work with and leads to performance issues for both the end user and people working with the code directly. Coding standards serve to solve this by offering guidelines that improve code quality and reduce errors and make the code more efficient to run and to work with. 
<br>

</p>

**Security**
<br>
When code is buggy, has logical errors or is even just inconsistent in the way its written it becomes vulnerable to attack. Coding standards work to remove faulty code thus making it more secure.


<br>

## **Common things seen in coding standards:**

</p>

### **Use of Globals** 
How often and where programmers should use global variables.

</p>

### **Naming Conventions:**
Programmers should indicate if a variable is local, global, a constant or a function by the way its name is declared. This is most often done through the use of camel case and capitalisation. Names should also be descriptive and kept as short as possible.

</p>

### **Indentation:**
This is one of the most important factors for code readability, tightly packed code becomes unreadable very quickly. This can be avoided by following indentation standards such as indenting and spacing each nested block of code.

  <img width="100" height="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/96/000000/length.png">
</p>

### **Function Length:**
Longer functions become very difficult to follow so it’s encouraged they are broken into smaller parts for each task the function is carrying out.

  <img width="100" height="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/material-outlined/96/000000/comments--v1.png">
</p>

### **Documentation**
Programmers should document their code using comments so as if another person has to work with the code  they can quickly understand what is going on.

<br>

## **Conclusion**
Coding standards help in generating code that is easy to read, understand and maintain. This improves code security and makes working with the code more efficient which benefits both the end user and programmers. It’s for these reasons why it’s important to adhere to existing coding standards wherever possible and to be thorough when designing standards of your own.

## **Introduction**

<br>


Coding reviews are undertaken by companies and organisations for various reasons.

In today's dynamic and evolving coding environment code reviews are necessary to ensure members of organisation are following the same protocols and methods whilst coding.

Code reviews are generally conducted by peers and are often referred to as peer reviews. The reviewers often will not have personally been involved in the code they are reviewing. This allows less bias opinions and more pragmatic approach.

Reviews are intended to point out the positive and negative aspects of a project.



<br>


### **Benefits of Code Reviews**

-	Adhering to Coding Standards
-	Team fluency & cohesion
-	Finding bugs & Errors
-	Teaching & Team development
-	Naming conventions & Comments



<br>

#### **Adhering to Coding Standards**
Companies will often have a guideline of coding Standards that are to be maintained by all members of the organisation

During code reviews the code itself is reviewed and ensured it follows the key principles set out in the organisations coding stands.

<br>

#### **Team Fluency & Cohesion**

<br>

When a code review is being undertaken it is important for the reviewer to keep the coder informed on their progress through the review.

Kepping both parties in the loop helps the reviwer have an understnading of the coders thought process and logic in certain areas.

If thing are unclear the reviwer will leave in their reviwe for an improvement in commenting and processes.



<br>

#### **Finding bugs & Errors**

<br>

</p>

<br>

Finding bugs and errors and bugs during a code review is one of the least costly ways of reviewing your code.

Having a new Un-biased set of eyes review changes and new methods allows for bugs to be spotted before they are released into production.


<br>

#### **Teaching & Team development**

<br>

</p>

<br>

Code reviews are valuable a part of a developers learning and progression. 

Having you peers and superiors review your code can allow for more learning and allows you to question your own process but also defend and explain your decisions.


<br>

#### **Naming conventions & Comments**



<br>

<p align = "left">
  <img width="150" height="150" src="https://icon-library.com/images/free-comment-icon/free-comment-icon-3.jpg">
</p>

<br>

Developers often get used to using industry standard when naming methods, classes and variables. but Companies often Follow their own naming conventions and styles.

This can often be a steep learning curve new employees no matter their level of experience.
People develop habits over time and get used to doing things a certain way. 

This is code reviews are extremely beneficial when a new employee is learning an organizations commenting rules and best practices.


Clear precise comments allow for future an ease in future adaptation and understanding. Which in turn allows for future adaptation and understanding from the next team member to work on the code


<br>

## **Conclusion**

Code reviews can be extremely beneficial and often even enjoyable when done correctly. 

Effective code reviews can lead to higher quality code, better cohesion and understanding of commenting 
, good knowledge sharing between teams in and organization and an overall improvement in team culture.

Code should also be reviewed in agile form. Review no more than 400 lines of code per session.

This should thin be brought to the coder to review the code between themselves and reviewer.
